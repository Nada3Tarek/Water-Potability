# Water-Potability
AI project to predict whether water is drinkable or not using SVM, Decision Tree, and other ML models.
# 💧 Water Potability Prediction using AI

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether water is **safe for drinking** or not, based on its physical and chemical properties.

---

## 🔬 Problem Statement

Access to safe drinking water is a global concern. This project uses AI to determine water potability using indicators such as pH, solids, turbidity, and more.
